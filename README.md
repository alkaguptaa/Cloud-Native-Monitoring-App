# Cloud-Native-Monitoring-App
The project system monitoring app is an application that allows you to monitor the health and performance of a computer system. The app is built using Python programming language and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.

Python is a popular and powerful programming language that is widely used in data science, web development, and system administration. Python provides a rich set of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop applications for different use cases. For the system monitoring app, Python can be used to collect system metrics, process the data, and present it in a meaningful way.

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a single container. Docker provides an isolated environment that can run anywhere, making it easy to deploy and scale applications. With Docker, you can build a container image that includes the Python code, dependencies, and any other components required by the system monitoring app.

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that allows you to manage and deploy containerized applications at scale. Kubernetes provides a set of tools and APIs that automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. With Kubernetes, you can deploy the system monitoring app as a set of containers, manage the resources, and scale the application based on demand.

In summary, the system monitoring app built using Python, Docker, and Kubernetes is a powerful tool for monitoring the health and performance of computer systems. By combining the simplicity and flexibility of Python with the containerization and orchestration capabilities of Docker and Kubernetes, you can build a scalable and reliable system monitoring solution.

To build the system monitoring app, Python can be used to collect system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, and more. The data can then be processed and presented in a user-friendly way, such as graphs or alerts. The Python code can be packaged into a Docker container image along with any other dependencies required by the app. This container image can then be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

Using Kubernetes, the containerized app can be managed and scaled based on demand. Kubernetes provides features such as auto-scaling, load balancing, and service discovery to ensure that the app is always available and responsive. Additionally, Kubernetes can provide logging and monitoring capabilities to help identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
